## Overview

In this assignment, we are rebuilding the Dalhousie University academic timetable using PHP, MySQL, and JSON. The application allows users to view available courses, log in, and manage their personal course schedules by adding or dropping courses asynchronously using Fetch API. This assignment focuses on key topics such as user authentication, session handling, asynchronous communication, and dynamic data retrieval.

dalhousie_timetable:

- courses: Contains course details (course_code, course_name, instructor, schedule).
- schedule: Links users to courses (user_id, course_id) for managing enrolled schedules.
- users: Stores user information (username, password, created_at) for schedule management.
